# ozone_lidar_proile_with_mixing_layer_height
Ozone lidar profiles (clean/polluted, four stages: Onset, Peak, Persistence, Dissipation) with overlaid ceilometer MLH. Categorized into clean/polluted night/daytime based on 1-h avg surface O₃ (CNEMC: clean &lt;200 μg m⁻³; polluted ≥200 μg m⁻³) and diurnal phase (daytime: 06:30–18:30 UTC+8; nighttime: ceilometer sunrise/sunset).
